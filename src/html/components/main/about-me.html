            <p>
                It's <strong>Bilal</strong>, B., Billy, Fatty boom boom, etc. I like chocolate.
                I like <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="food">food</span>, basically.
                Other than that, I like spending time on the internetz, watching movies, tv shows, football and cricket matches.
                Nowadays, trust me or not, I'm trying to spend some time in the <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="gym">gym</span> - although, mostly, it's just a train of thought.
            </p>

            <p>Truthfully, I just think that <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="trying-new-shit">learning new things</span> is essential,
                because trying and failing is (almost always) a guaranteed learning experience.
                That being said, I like setting the bar high, and <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="risky">taking risks</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most people think of me as a relaxed guy. I'll have a laugh at what not. Pretty crazy. <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="blablabla">Blablabla</span>.
                Naturally, people tend to go by first appearance, and I have a somewhat static/neutral face expression, but that's all lies man.
                I'd like to think that I'm creative, supportive, loyal, love to have fun but also word hard. I get energy from taking on challenges.
                I love <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="crazy-prank">silly pranks</span> and jokes.
                Sometimes I'm a bit busy and sometimes, well, I have migraine. By the way, these are loads of "I's".
                Sigh, I don't know, I don't like talking about myself, it's a bit <span class="js-trigger-gif btn--gif" data-gif="awkward">awkward</span>, don't you think?
